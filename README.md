# NeuroTechX-Alzheimers-Identification
This project was created for the NeuroTechX summer 2023 competition. It analyzes several ML/DL methods for Alzheimer's and fronto-temporal dementia detection. Tools such as ICA, PCA, PLSDA, and CWT were used to prepare data for models including SVM, KNN, random forests, gradient boosted decision trees, MLP, and CNN.
